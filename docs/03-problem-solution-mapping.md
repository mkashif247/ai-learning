## Part 1: Learning Problems

### Problem 1: "Tutorial Hell"

**The Issue**: Learners endlessly watch tutorials without building real skills. They understand the instructor but can't code independently.

**Root Causes**:

- Passive consumption vs. active practice
- Fear of making mistakes
- No immediate feedback loop

**LearnPath Solution**:

|---|---|
| **"Practice Now" Button** | Every topic has a coding challenge. No reading without doing. |
| **AI Tutor** | When stuck, get help on YOUR code—not generic examples. |
| **No Copy-Paste** | Editor encourages typing; starter code is minimal. |

### Problem 2: Lack of Structure

**The Issue**: Learners don't know what to learn, in what order, or what's enough.

**Root Causes**:

- Overwhelming number of resources
- No personalized guidance
- "Shiny object syndrome" (jumping between topics)

**LearnPath Solution**:
| Feature | How It Helps |
|---|---|
| **AI Roadmap Generator** | Personalized path based on goal (job, skill), timeline, and level. |
| **Phase-Based Structure** | Clear milestones: "Complete Phase 1 to unlock Phase 2." |

### Problem 5: Burnout & Inconsistency

**The Issue**: Learners start strong, then fade. Life gets in the way; motivation drops.
